    "Data Hiding:\n",
    "The Python document introduces Data Hiding as isolating the user from a part of program implementation. Some objects in the module are kept internal, unseen, and unreachable to the user. Modules in the program are easy enough to understand how to use the application, but the client cannot know how the application functions. Thus, data hiding imparts security, along with discarding dependency. Data hiding in Python is the technique to defend access to specific users in the application. Python is applied in every technical area and has a user-friendly syntax and vast libraries. Data hiding in Python is performed using the __ double underscore before done prefix. This makes the class members non-public and isolated from the other classes.\n",

    "Access Control:\n",
    "Python uses ‘_’ symbol to determine the access control for a specific data member or a member function of a class. Access specifiers in Python have an important role to play in securing data from unauthorized access and in preventing it from being exploited.\n",
    "A Class in Python has three types of access modifiers:\n",

    "Data Hiding : While data hiding focuses on restricting data use in a program to assure data security, data encapsulation focuses on wrapping (or encapsulating) the complex data to present a simpler view to the user. In data hiding, the data has to be defined as private only. In data encapsulation, the data can be public or private.The Python document introduces Data Hiding as isolating the user from a part of program implementation. Some objects in the module are kept internal, unseen, and unreachable to the user. Modules in the program are easy enough to understand how to use the application, but the client cannot know how the application functions. Thus, data hiding imparts security, along with discarding dependency. Data hiding in Python is the technique to defend access to specific users in the application. Python is applied in every technical area and has a user-friendly syntax and vast libraries. Data hiding in Python is performed using the __ double underscore before done prefix. This makes the class members non-public and isolated from the other classes.\n",

    "Polymorphism is taken from the Greek words Poly (many) and morphism (forms). It means that the same function name can be used for different types. This makes programming more intuitive and easier. A child class inherits all the methods from the parent class. However, in some situations, the method inherited from the parent class doesn’t quite fit into the child class. In such cases, you will have to re-implement method in the child class.\n",

    "Abstraction in Python refers to the concept of hiding the complex implementation details of an object and exposing only the essential features or functionalities. It is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming (OOP) and allows programmers to focus on the high-level functionality of an object without being concerned about the low-level implementation details.In Python, abstraction is achieved through the use of classes and objects. Here's how abstraction is related to object-oriented programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Classes and Objects: Classes in Python serve as blueprints for creating objects. They encapsulate data and behavior.Objects are instances of classes and represent real-world entities. They encapsulate the state and behavior defined by their respective classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Encapsulation: Abstraction is closely related to encapsulation, which is another OOP concept.Encapsulation involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, i.e., a class.Through encapsulation, the internal details of how a class works are hidden from the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Access Modifiers:In Python, there are no strict access modifiers like in some other languages (e.g., public, private, protected). However, naming conventions are used to indicate the level of visibility.By convention, attributes prefixed with a single underscore (_attribute) are considered protected, and those with double underscores (__attribute) are considered private. This indicates that they are not intended to be accessed directly from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstract Classes and Methods: Python supports abstract classes and methods through the abc (Abstract Base Classes) module.Abstract classes can have abstract methods (methods without a defined implementation) that must be implemented by concrete subclasses.\n",
    "Abstract classes provide a level of abstraction by defining a common interface that subclasses must adhere to, allowing for a consistent way of interacting with different objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "1. Create class called Shape which initiates the method of abstract method to calculate the area of shape\n",
    "2. Create another class called circle which is inherit fromm the shape class inside the class create a method area which overides the method inside the class shape and calculate area of circle\n",
    "3. Create another class called square which is inherit fromm the shape class inside the class create a method area which overides the method inside the class shape and calculate area of square\n",
    "4. Print the result"

    "Here are the key aspects of the significance of encapsulation in achieving abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Hiding:Encapsulation allows the internal details of a class, such as its attributes and implementation, to be hidden from the outside world.By controlling access to the internal state of an object, encapsulation prevents external code from directly manipulating or modifying the object's data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Access Control:Encapsulation provides a way to control the visibility and accessibility of the attributes and methods of a class.Access modifiers, such as private, protected, and public, determine whether an attribute or method can be accessed from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Abstraction: Encapsulation contributes to abstraction by exposing only the necessary information and functionalities of an object while hiding the complexity.Users of a class interact with its public interface, which consists of methods that provide a high-level abstraction of the object's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Code Organization:Encapsulation helps in organizing code by grouping related data and methods into a coherent unit (class).This modular structure improves code readability, maintainability, and the ability to manage complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "1. The BankAccount class encapsulates the data (account holder and balance) and methods (deposit, withdraw, get_balance).\n",
    "2. The attributes __balance and _account_holder are private and protected, respectively, indicating that they are not intended to be accessed directly from outside the class.\n",
    "3. Public methods (deposit, withdraw, get_balance) provide controlled access to the encapsulated data, enforcing abstraction and preventing direct manipulation of the object's internal state."

    "Here are the key purposes of abstract methods and how they enforce abstraction in Python classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Defining a Common Interface:Abstract methods define a set of method signatures (names and parameters) in an abstract class without providing any implementation.This common interface establishes a contract that concrete subclasses must fulfill by implementing these abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Forcing Implementation in Subclasses:Abstract methods do not have a default implementation in the abstract class, making it mandatory for concrete subclasses to provide their own implementations.Subclasses that fail to implement an abstract method will also be treated as abstract classes, and instances of such classes cannot be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Promoting Consistency: By defining a common set of abstract methods, abstract classes promote consistency in the behavior of related classes.Different subclasses implementing the same abstract methods ensure a uniform way of interacting with objects of these classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Enabling Polymorphism:Abstract methods enable polymorphism by allowing different classes to implement the same interface.This polymorphic behavior allows objects of different classes to be used interchangeably when they share a common abstract class.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Providing a Blueprint: Abstract methods serve as a blueprint or a template for concrete subclasses. They outline the expected behavior that subclasses must conform to.Subclasses use the abstract class as a guide for creating their own specific implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "1. Shape is an abstract class with an abstract method calculate_area.\n",
    "2. Concrete subclasses (Circle and Square) inherit from Shape and provide their specific implementations for the abstract method.\n",
    "3. The abstract method calculate_area enforces a common interface for all subclasses, ensuring that each shape class must implement a method to calculate its area.\n"

    "Abstract Data Types (ADTs) are high-level descriptions of data structures and the operations that can be performed on them, independent of their specific implementation details. ADTs focus on what operations can be performed on the data and what properties these operations should have, rather than how these operations are implemented. ADTs provide a way to abstract away the complexities of data structures, promoting a clear separation between the interface and the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Role of ADTs in Achieving Abstraction in Python:\n",
    "1. Encapsulation and Abstraction: ADTs encapsulate the implementation details of data structures, providing a clear separation between the interface and the internal workings. Abstraction is achieved by allowing users to interact with the data structure through a well-defined set of operations without needing to understand the intricate details of its implementation.\n",
    "2. Code Organization and Modularity: ADTs promote code organization and modularity by defining a standardized way to interact with data structures. Users can use ADTs without worrying about the internal complexities, fostering a modular and organized code structure.\n",
    "3. Code Reusability: ADTs support code reusability by providing a consistent interface for different implementations of the same abstract data type. Users can switch between different implementations of an ADT without modifying their code, as long as the interface remains the same.\n",
    "4. Ease of Maintenance: Because ADTs separate the interface from the implementation, maintenance efforts are focused on the internal details of data structures without affecting the code that uses them. Changes to the implementation of an ADT can be made without impacting the code that relies on the ADT's interface.\n",
    "5. Flexibility and Adaptability: ADTs provide flexibility by allowing different implementations of the same abstract data type to be used interchangeably. This adaptability is valuable in situations where the choice of a specific data structure may depend on factors such as performance, memory usage, or other requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "1. In this example, the Stack class defines the interface for a stack ADT. \n",
    "2. Users interact with the stack through the push, pop, peek, is_empty, and size operations, achieving abstraction and encapsulation of the underlying list implementation.\n",
    "3. The user does not need to be concerned with the details of how the stack operations are implemented using a list; they only need to know the expected behavior of the stack."

    "1. Simplifies Complexity: Abstraction allows developers to focus on high-level concepts and hide the intricate details of a system. This simplification is crucial in large-scale projects where the complexity can be overwhelming. By breaking down the system into manageable components and abstracting away unnecessary details, developers can better understand and work on specific parts of the software without being bogged down by the entire system's complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Enhances Maintainability: Abstraction promotes code modularity and encapsulation, making it easier to maintain and update the software. Each module or component can be treated as a black box with well-defined interfaces, allowing changes to be made within a specific module without affecting the rest of the system. This modular approach simplifies debugging, testing, and updating, ultimately reducing the maintenance burden.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Promotes Code Reusability: Abstraction encourages the creation of reusable components or libraries. Once a module or abstraction is designed and implemented, it can be easily reused in other parts of the system or in different projects. This not only saves development time but also improves consistency across the software, as the same abstraction can be used consistently in various contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Facilitates Collaboration: Large-scale software projects typically involve multiple developers and teams working on different aspects of the system simultaneously. Abstraction provides a clear and well-defined interface between components, allowing teams to work independently on their assigned tasks without having to understand the entire system intricacies. This promotes parallel development and facilitates collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Improves System Understanding: Abstraction allows developers to reason about the software at a higher level of abstraction, focusing on essential concepts and relationships. This higher-level understanding is crucial for effective communication among team members, stakeholders, and even for documentation purposes. It helps in creating a conceptual model that aids in discussions, decision-making, and troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Enables Future Extensibility: Well-designed abstractions provide a foundation for future system extensions and modifications. When the underlying complexity is abstracted away, it becomes easier to introduce new features or make changes without disrupting the existing functionality. This adaptability is essential for software systems that need to evolve and scale over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Supports Testing and Debugging: Abstraction makes it easier to test individual components in isolation, leading to more effective unit testing. Debugging also becomes more manageable, as developers can focus on specific modules without being overwhelmed by the entire system's intricacies. This can result in quicker and more accurate identification and resolution of issues."

    "Abstraction plays a crucial role in enhancing code reusability and modularity in Python programs. Python, being a versatile and expressive programming language, provides features that support abstraction effectively. Here's how abstraction contributes to these aspects in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation:\n",
    "Explanation: Abstraction in Python allows developers to encapsulate the implementation details of a module or class, exposing only what is necessary through well-defined interfaces.\n",
    "Example: Consider a Python class representing a database connection. The internal details, such as connection pooling, error handling, and query execution, can be encapsulated within the class. Users of this class need only be concerned with methods like connect(), execute_query(), and close(). This encapsulation ensures that changes to the internal implementation won't affect the code that uses the class.\n",

    "2. Class and Function Abstraction:\n",
    "Explanation: In Python, classes and functions serve as primary abstractions. Classes allow bundling data and behavior, while functions encapsulate specific operations.\n",
    "Example: A Python module might contain a class representing a geometric shape with methods like calculate_area() and calculate_perimeter(). Another module could define a function that operates on lists, abstracting away the details of the algorithm. These abstractions promote code reusability since the same class or function can be used in different parts of the program or even in other projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance and Polymorphism:\n",
    "Explanation: Python supports inheritance, allowing the creation of new classes based on existing ones. Polymorphism allows different classes to be used interchangeably based on a common interface.\n",
    "Example: In a graphical user interface (GUI) library, you might have an abstract Widget class with common methods like draw() and handle_event(). Specific widgets like buttons and text boxes can inherit from this class, ensuring a consistent interface. The program can then use polymorphism to interact with various widgets without knowing their specific types.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Module-Level Abstraction:\n",
    "Explanation: Python modules abstract functionality, allowing the organization of code into separate files. This supports modularity by breaking down the program into smaller, manageable components.\n",
    "Example: In a web application, you might have separate modules for handling user authentication, database interactions, and routing. Each module abstracts away its internal details, providing clear interfaces. This modular design enhances code reusability as modules can be used across different parts of the application or in entirely different projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Abstract Base Classes (ABCs):\n",
    "Explanation: Python's abc module allows the creation of abstract base classes, providing a way to define a common interface for a group of related classes.\n",
    "Example: If you're developing a library for different storage backends, you could create an abstract base class Storage with methods like read() and write(). Concrete classes for specific storage types (e.g., FileStorage, DatabaseStorage) would then inherit from this base class. This ensures a consistent interface across different storage implementations, promoting code reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Duck Typing:\n",
    "Explanation: Python follows the principle of \"duck typing,\" which focuses on the object's behavior rather than its type. This promotes flexibility and code reusability by allowing different objects to be used interchangeably if they support the required methods or attributes.\n",
    "Example: A function that expects an object with a calculate() method can work with any object that provides this method, regardless of its class. This encourages code reusability, as new objects with the same method can be easily integrated into existing code."

    "Here's how method abstraction and polymorphism are interconnected in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Abstraction through Interfaces: Method abstraction is often achieved through the use of interfaces or abstract base classes (ABCs) in Python. An interface defines a set of methods that must be implemented by any concrete class that inherits from it. However, the interface itself doesn't provide the implementation details. For example, an abstract class may declare a method like calculate_area() without specifying how the area is calculated. Concrete subclasses, such as Circle or Rectangle, then provide their specific implementations.\n",
    "2. Polymorphism: Polymorphism, a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming, allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. In Python, polymorphism is often achieved through method overriding and duck typing. With method overriding, a subclass can provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows different objects to respond to the same method call in a way that is appropriate for their type. Duck typing, on the other hand, allows objects to be used based on their behavior rather than their type. If an object has a method with a specific name and signature, it can be used in a context expecting an object with that method, regardless of its class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "1. In this example, the Shape class defines an abstract method calculate_area(). \n",
    "2. The Circle and Rectangle classes implement this method with their specific area calculation logic.\n",
    "3. The print_area function takes a Shape object as an argument, demonstrating polymorphism by accepting different shapes and calling their calculate_area methods."

    "1. Flexibility and Modifiability:\n",
    "Composition: With composition, classes are more flexible and modifiable. Components can be added, removed, or replaced without affecting the entire class hierarchy.\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance can be rigid. Changes to a superclass can have a cascading effect on all its subclasses, making the system less adaptable to modifications.\n",
    "2. Reduced Coupling:\n",
    "Composition: Components (objects of other classes) are loosely coupled with the containing class. This reduces dependencies and makes it easier to replace or modify components independently.\n",
    "Inheritance: Subclasses are tightly coupled with their superclasses. Changes to a superclass can affect all its subclasses, potentially introducing unintended side effects.\n",
    "3. Code Reusability:\n",
    "Composition: Composition promotes code reusability by allowing the reuse of individual components in different contexts. Components can be shared among multiple classes.\n",
    "Inheritance: Code reuse in inheritance is achieved through extension. While it allows for reusing methods from a superclass, it can lead to a less modular and more tightly coupled design.\n",
    "4. Avoiding Fragile Base Class Problem:\n",
    "Composition: Composition avoids the \"fragile base class\" problem, where changes to a base class can unintentionally affect all its derived classes.\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance can be prone to the fragile base class problem, where modifications to a base class may inadvertently break existing subclasses.\n",
    "5. Encapsulation:\n",
    "Composition: Encapsulation is enhanced as each class is responsible for its own behavior, and the containing class delegates specific tasks to its components.\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance may expose more implementation details of the superclass to its subclasses, potentially violating encapsulation.\n",
    "6. Better Modeling of \"Has-a\" Relationships:\n",
    "Composition: Composition is well-suited for modeling \"has-a\" relationships between classes. For example, a Car has an Engine and Wheels.\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is typically used for \"is-a\" relationships, where a subclass is considered a specific type of its superclass.\n",
    "7. Easier Unit Testing:\n",
    "Composition: Components can be easily mocked or replaced during unit testing, allowing for more straightforward testing of individual functionalities.\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance might make it more challenging to isolate and test specific functionalities independently due to the interdependencies between classes in the hierarchy.\n",
    "8. Avoiding Diamond Inheritance Problem:\n",
    "Composition: Composition avoids the diamond inheritance problem, which can occur when a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor. This problem can lead to ambiguity and complexity.\n",
    "Inheritance: Multiple inheritance can lead to the diamond inheritance problem, requiring careful management to avoid confusion and maintain clarity in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "1. The Car class is composed of instances of the Engine and Wheels classes. \n",
    "2. It encapsulates the functionality related to starting, stopping, and driving.\n",
    "3. Composition allows the Car class to delegate specific tasks to the Engine and Wheels instances without inheriting their entire implementation.\n",
    "4. The start, stop, and drive methods of the Car class demonstrate how composition is used to build complex behavior from the simpler components.\n"

    "The concept of \"delegation\" in composition involves one object (or class) assigning responsibility for a particular task to another object. This is achieved by creating an instance of another class within a class and then forwarding or delegating specific operations to that instance. Delegation is a powerful design pattern that promotes code reuse, modularity, and flexibility in building complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points:\n",
    "1. Delegating Responsibility: In a composition-based design, an object delegates specific responsibilities or tasks to another object.The delegating object contains an instance of the delegate object and relies on it to perform certain operations.\n",
    "2. Code Reuse: Delegation promotes code reuse by allowing the reuse of existing classes or components without inheriting their entire implementation.Components can be easily swapped or extended without affecting the overall structure of the system.\n",
    "3. Modularity: Delegation contributes to modularity in software design. Each class is responsible for a specific set of tasks, making the codebase more organized and easier to maintain.\n",
    "4. Encapsulation: Delegation enhances encapsulation by encapsulating the details of specific tasks within individual classes.Each class is responsible for its own behavior, and the delegating class does not need to expose the details of the delegated tasks.\n",
    "5. Reduced Coupling:Delegation reduces coupling between classes. The delegating class is not tightly coupled to the internal details of the delegate class, promoting a more loosely coupled system.\n",
    "6. Flexibility: Delegation provides flexibility in design. Components can be easily replaced or extended without affecting the overall structure of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "1. Consider a text editor system where a TextEditor class delegates the functionality of saving documents to a FileManager class\n",
    "2. The FileManager class is responsible for saving documents.\n",
    "3. The TextEditor class contains an instance of FileManager and delegates the responsibility of saving documents to it."

    "1. Increased Complexity:\n",
    "As the number of composed objects increases, the complexity of managing and coordinating interactions between them can grow. This can make the code harder to understand and maintain, especially in large-scale systems.\n",
    "2. Potential for Tight Coupling:\n",
    "If the composition is not carefully managed, it can lead to tight coupling between objects. Tight coupling occurs when the internal details of one object are closely tied to the internal details of another object, making it difficult to modify one without affecting the other.\n",
    "3. Dependency Management:\n",
    "Managing dependencies between composed objects can be challenging. Changes in one component might have a ripple effect on other components, potentially requiring extensive modifications throughout the system.\n",
    "4. Constructor Overhead:\n",
    "The process of creating instances of composed objects and passing them to the constructor of the containing class can lead to constructor overhead. This becomes more apparent when dealing with a large number of dependencies.\n",
    "5. Potential for Code Duplication:\n",
    "In some cases, composition may lead to code duplication if multiple classes use the same set of composed objects. This can happen when the same components are needed across different classes.\n",
    "6. Limited Code Reuse in Some Cases:\n",
    "While composition promotes code reuse, there are scenarios where it might not be as effective as inheritance. Inheritance allows for more straightforward reuse of code through the \"is-a\" relationship.\n",
    "7. Design Decisions and Flexibility:\n",
    "Poor design decisions during composition can result in a less flexible system. It may become challenging to modify or extend the system without introducing unintended side effects.\n",
    "8. Potential for Runtime Performance Overhead:\n",
    "Depending on the implementation, the use of composition can introduce runtime performance overhead, especially if there are many objects interacting with each other. This can impact the overall efficiency of the system.\n",
    "9. Diamond Inheritance Problem (Multiple Inheritance):\n",
    "While composition itself does not suffer from the diamond inheritance problem, it can still arise if multiple inheritance is used in combination with composition. This problem can introduce ambiguity and complexity in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Car class is composed of instances of the Engine and Wheels classes. \n",
    "2. It encapsulates the functionality related to starting, stopping, and driving.\n",
    "3. Composition allows the Car class to delegate specific tasks to the Engine and Wheels instances without inheriting their entire implementation.\n",
    "4. The start, stop, and drive methods of the Car class demonstrate how composition is used to build complex behavior from the simpler components."

    "1. Encapsulation and Abstraction:\n",
    "Composition promotes encapsulation by allowing each class to encapsulate its own behavior and data. This means that the internal details of a class are hidden from the outside, and interactions occur through well-defined interfaces. This encapsulation aids in abstraction, where the complexity of a component is hidden behind a simplified and understandable interface.\n",
    "2. Modularity:\n",
    "Composition allows for the creation of modular code by breaking down a system into smaller, independent components. Each component is responsible for a specific aspect of the functionality, making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend. Modules can be developed and tested independently, facilitating code organization.\n",
    "3. Code Reusability:\n",
    "Components created through composition are inherently reusable. A well-designed component can be used in different contexts or even in entirely different projects without modification. This reuse of components reduces redundancy, leads to cleaner code, and accelerates development.\n",
    "4. Flexibility and Extensibility:\n",
    "Composition provides flexibility in modifying and extending a system. Changes to one component do not necessarily impact others, making it easier to adapt the codebase to evolving requirements. New features can be added by introducing new components or modifying existing ones without affecting the entire system.\n",
    "5. Dependency Management:\n",
    "Composition helps manage dependencies between components. Dependencies are explicit and well-defined, making it clear which components rely on others. This transparency simplifies the identification and resolution of dependencies, enhancing overall code maintainability.\n",
    "6. Reduced Code Coupling:\n",
    "Composition typically results in looser coupling between classes. Objects interact through well-defined interfaces, and changes to one class are less likely to cause a ripple effect throughout the entire system. This loose coupling contributes to a more maintainable and adaptable codebase.\n",
    "7. Testing and Debugging:\n",
    "Modular components created through composition are easier to test in isolation. Unit testing can be performed on individual components, simplifying the debugging process. This isolated testing also contributes to the overall reliability and robustness of the code.\n",
    "8. Improved Readability:\n",
    "A composition-based design often leads to more readable code. Each class or module has a specific responsibility, and the relationships between components are clearly defined. This clarity improves code readability, making it easier for developers to understand and collaborate on the codebase.\n",
    "9. Scalability:\n",
    "Composition facilitates scalability by allowing developers to add new features or scale the system by introducing new components. The modular nature of composition makes it easier to scale a project without introducing unnecessary complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Car class is composed of instances of the Engine and Wheels classes. \n",
    "2. It encapsulates the functionality related to starting, stopping, and driving.\n",
    "3. Composition allows the Car class to delegate specific tasks to the Engine and Wheels instances without inheriting their entire implementation.\n",
    "4. The start, stop, and drive methods of the Car class demonstrate how composition is used to build complex behavior from the simpler components."

    "In object-oriented programming, \"aggregation\" is a form of composition where one class (the whole or container) contains another class (the part) as a component.

    "1. Whole-Part Relationship: Aggregation represents a whole-part relationship, where one class (the whole) contains another class (the part).\n",
    "2. Loose Coupling: In aggregation, the contained object (part) can exist independently of the container (whole). The container does not fully own the lifecycle of the contained object, resulting in loose coupling between the two.\n",
    "3. Bi-directional Association: Objects involved in aggregation have a bi-directional association. Both the whole and the part can reference each other, but they are not tightly coupled.\n",
    "4. Shared Ownership: The contained object in aggregation can be shared among multiple containers or may exist independently. The destruction of the whole does not necessarily lead to the destruction of the part.\n",
